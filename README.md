# Valentine's Day Gift Website

## About this project
This project is a personalized website designed to showcase a collection of memories and gifts from past Valentine's Days. It gathers these special moments and renders them into a new, beautiful experience.

## Technical Features
- **Client-side Encryption:** Some documents are stored as encrypted Markdown files and decrypted on-the-fly using a custom Caesar-cipher-based logic.
- **Session Management:** Custom `SessionManager` class to handle authentication states and user preferences without a backend.
- **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns using ES6 Modules.

## Technologies
The project is built with pure web technologies (no frameworks):
- HTML5.
- CSS3 (Custom animations).
- JavaScript (ES6+ Modules).
- [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) for Markdown parsing.

## Credits
Proudly designed and developed by **Badjavii**.
